# Star Wars GraphQL Server

This is a demo app for learning GraphQL with the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/). I used it for my talk entitled "No REST for the weary... Introducing GraphQL".

To run, first `npm install` or `yarn`. Then run the server with `npm run dev`. At localhost:4000 you will see the GraphiQl interface.

## Branches

Check out the `basic_working_app` branch for the more bare-bones version of the application that is completed by the end of my talk.

To play with a more built-out version that includes more of the Star Wars API endpoints, check out `full_sw_api`, or simply the `master` branch.

### Ecosystem

**GraphQL Servers**

- [GraphQL-JS](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) (Node) - original implementation, use with [express-graphql](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql) 
- [Apollo-Server](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server) (Node) - by [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) 
- [Other Platforms and languages](http://graphql.org/code/) 

**GraphQL Clients** - not required, but easier

- [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) - Facebook’s GraphQL toolkit. 
- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/client/) - Use with  a connector for your front-end framework of choice
- [React-Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/), [Angular-Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/angular/), etc.).

**Other GraphQL Tools**

- [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) - handy in-browser IDE for querying GraphQL endpoints.
- [DataLoader](https://github.com/facebook/dataloader) - batching and caching library, by Facebook.
- [Create GraphQL Server](https://blog.hichroma.com/create-graphql-server-instantly-scaffold-a-graphql-server-1ebad1e71840) - command line tool to scaffold a GraphQL server using Node and a Mongo database.
- [GraphQL-up](https://www.graph.cool/graphql-up/) - another tool to quickly bootstrap a new GraphQL back-end powered by [GraphCool](https://www.graph.cool/)’s service.
