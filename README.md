# Star Wars GraphQL Server
This is a demo app for learning GraphQL with the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/). I used it for my talk entitled "No REST for the weary... Introducing GraphQL".

To run, first `npm install` or `yarn`. Then run the server with `npm run dev`. At localhost:4000 you will see the GraphiQl interface.

## Branches
Check out the `basic_working_app` branch for the more bare-bones version of the application that is completed by the end of my talk.

To play with a more built-out version that includes more of the Star Wars API endpoints, check out `full_sw_api`, or simply the `master` branch.
